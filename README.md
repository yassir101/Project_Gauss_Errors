# Project_MMSN_Gauss_Errors
In this project, we will explore Gauss’s method in the context of solving linear systems numerically, with a particular focus on error propagation phenomena. We will investigate how different pivoting strategies and preconditioning techniques can affect the accuracy of results, and use modern diagnostic tools such as the GDB debugger to analyze code-level errors. Our aim is to combine a deep historical and theoretical understanding with practical programming skills to enhance the reliability of scientific computations.

Objectives

	•	Understand the numerical resolution of linear systems using Gauss’s method.
	•	Analyze error propagation in the context of linear systems.
	•	Study the impact of pivoting strategies and preconditioning on result accuracy.
	•	Use modern debugging tools (GDB) to diagnose and correct coding errors.
	•	Strengthen practical programming skills to improve the reliability of scientific computations.

Tools and Technologies
